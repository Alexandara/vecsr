Note: There is some non-determinism in where the agent will start in the VirtualHome apartment. In the optimized version,
the agent is started next to the counter with the breadslice310 and toaster309. In the ICLP 2025 paper, we reference a
run where the agent was spawned farther away from the counter and got this action plan:
[walk(toaster309),switchon(toaster309),walk(breadslice310),grab(breadslice310),walk(toaster309),put(breadslice310,toaster309),eat(breadslice310)]
