Note: When run dynamically, there can be slight variations on the solution. The agent simply finds something that can
be read and something comfortable to sit on, so there are different solutions that may be generated based on small
differences in the simulated environment. The solution referenced in the ICLP 2025 paper is as follows:
[walk(bedroom74),walk(book192),grab(book192),walk(chair109),sit(chair109),use(book192)]
